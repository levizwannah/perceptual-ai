# perceptual-ai
I think AI isn't really going to just breakout from ANI into AGI. Good that we have a lot of data, but that doesn't mean, it's AGI. In the repo, I will develop a different AI. In the process, I will make hypothesis, propose conclusions, and build from the ground up. It might not work though, but it's worth the try.
